# JavaScript30 Challenge - Day 13

This repository is part of the JavaScript30 challenge by Wes Bos. The JavaScript30 challenge involves building 30 different projects with vanilla JavaScript in 30 days.

## Day 13: Slide In on Scroll

### Description
In this project, we implemented a feature where images slide into view as the user scrolls down the page. This was achieved using JavaScript to calculate the position of the images and apply CSS classes for sliding in and out based on the scroll position.

### What Was Learned
- Utilizing the `scroll` event to trigger actions based on scroll position.
- Calculating element positions and sizes relative to the viewport and scroll position.
- Applying CSS transitions and classes dynamically with JavaScript for smooth animations.

### Project Structure
- `index.html`: HTML file containing the structure and content of the page.
- `style.css`: CSS file for styling the page.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file for implementing the slide-in effect based on scroll.

### How to Run
Simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the project and observe the slide-in effect as you scroll.
